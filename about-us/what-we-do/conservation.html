            Cheetah Conservation Fund‚Äôs holistic conservation strategy is the key to success in saving the cheetah and its ecosystem. CCF works to develop best practices that benefit the entire ecosystem upon which the cheetah depends. CCF‚Äôs programs address the concerns for wildlife populations and the human communities that share the landscape.

            CCF‚Äôs Cheetah Rescue and Conservation Centre (CRCC) serves as a rehabilitation center and sanctuary for long term care of cheetahs confiscated from the illegal pet trade by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MoECC). Completed in 2023, the CRCC is the hub of activity for CCF‚Äôs research and education driven conservation plan for the region.

            CCF breeds Anatolian shepherd and mixed breed dogs to become LGDs. Now, and for thousands of years, the breed is used to guard small livestock against wolves and bears in Turkey. LGDs are placed with Namibian farmers as puppies. The puppies bond with the herd or flock. As they grow up, their size and loud bark help to scare predators away.

            Conservancies
        </h3>
        <p>
            CCF is a member of Namibia‚Äôs Conservancy movement. Conservancies are operated by groups of land owners committed to responsibly manage wildlife. Protecting Namibia‚Äôs wildlife treasures is proven to be economically beneficial to conservancies.

            In Namibia, areas governed by conservancies are more resistant to poachers. The Greater Waterberg Landscape is the conservancy and economic development area in which CCF participates. CCF works with communal farmers and people living around the Waterberg plateau as part of our holistic conservation strategy.

            Biomass Technology Development and Bushblok
        </h3>
        <p>
            In 2001, the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) collaborated to find a habitat improvement program that would be good for both the ecology and the economy.
        </p>
        <p>
            CCF is working on a long-term research and development project to restore habitat while developing a renewable fuel source. Overgrown thorn bush is harvested and made into high-heat, low-emission, fuel logs for consumer use. As part of CCF‚Äôs programs, CCF Bush (PTY) Ltd. leads our Bushblok program. As the Bushblok program grows, CCF creates new biomass energy potential. As of 2017, CCF operates a biomass technology research and education program at the Biomass Technology Demonstration Centre.

            Livelihood Development

        <p>
            The key to securing a future for the cheetah, is to secure the livelihoods of the people who share its habitat. Through livelihood development, CCF assists the communities living in cheetah-country. People learn the skills to expand their income at our Model Farm. CCF helps local artisans by promoting their jewelry craft and cultural art pieces in our on-site gift shop

            The Dancing Goat Creamery creates and sells dairy products made from CCF‚Äôs goat milk. The Creamery serves as an example for small stock farmers. Farmers learn how to expand their income by creating new and marketable products. CCF produces honey at our apiary, and grows grapes for wine making. CCF continues to develop new ways for communal farmers to boost their income.
