<p>People like cheetahs. Cheetahs are the world’s fastest land animal, capable of reaching speeds of 70 miles per hour. They are beautiful. They are the only big cats that can purr. They have fascinated people for over 4,000 years. Helping people live side by side with cheetahs is the key to Africa’s most endangered big cats’ survival.</p>
<p>Children around the world learn about the cheetah and its remarkable speed. It’s astonishing how many facts even the youngest children can recite about the cheetah. However, most people around the world don’t know how critically endangered the cheetah is — with numbers down from 100,000 in the wild in 1900 to fewer than 7,500 today. </p>
<p>If the cheetah loses its race for survival, the American Prong-horn Antelope will become the fastest land mammal, and all those textbooks naming the cheetah as the fastest land animal will need to be changed. More importantly, entire ecosystems are disturbed when a top predator like the cheetah is removed. </p>
